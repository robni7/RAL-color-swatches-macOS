# RAL-swatches-macOS
RAL sRGB swatches for macOS color picker (.clr)

In the attached files you will find the sRGB approximations for all RAL Classic colours, sourced from Wikipedia and grouped by range.

The names are currently in Dutch, but the codes are universal, of course.    
 
    
<b>USAGE</b>    
Import the .clr files in ~/Library/colours or click the gear and select Open... in the colour picker (visible on the 3rd tab).
You might also find https://github.com/ramonpoca/ColorTools/tree/0.2 useful if you want to to use the pallettes in other software.

<b>IMPORTANT</b>    
The included values are only approximations of the RAL colours within the limitations of the sRGB colour space, so they may not match real-world paints, dyes, prints, etc.
